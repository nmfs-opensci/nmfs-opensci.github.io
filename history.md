## History

NOAA Fisheries scientists have been involved in Open Science and production of Open Source packages for many years, really from the beginning of "open source". However, the current effort towards agency-wide training in Open Science aligns with the transition to Open Science workflows and tools that is occurring across science and across scientific organizations. Organized and higher-profile efforts can be traced to the mid-2000s with the "toolbox" cross-agency initiatives and more recently to efforts in the agency's stock assessments community.

* mid-2010s to present. The Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (FIT) Initiative worked to develop a collaborative community, coding standards, GitHub training and R resources for staff working on stock assessment. The FIT successes and community helped the efforts for training in modern data science workflows and tools across the agency.
* 2020 Individual trainings in R and R Markdown were held by NOAA Fisheries staff at Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, and Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Though not associated with NMFS Openscapes, these trainings showed the high demand and need for this type of training across the agency.
* 2021 Spring Openscapes cohort was organized at NWFSC. The 2021 RWorkflow workshops by the MathBio Program at NWFSC where offered to staff across the entire agency and helped develop interest in more training opportunities. Fall cohorts organized at NEFSC and a cross-center cohort involving NWFSC, NEFSC, SEFSC and AFSC. NMFS R User Group established by AFSC and NWFSC staff and quickly grew to over 100 participants across all the centers with monthly meetings on topics of interest and an active chat/Q&A board. NMFS Openscapes formed to promote Open Science adoption with the agency.
* 2022 Winter Openscapes cohort organized at AFSC. NMFS Openscapes develops a 3-year proposal for support of Openscapes and Open Science at the national level (within agency) to allow for broader individual and team training. Summer cohort planned for SEFSC. Fall cohorts being planned. PSAW III Workshops on on R packages developed by staff and GitHub topics attract 100s of staff across the agency. RWorkflow workshops to be offered again in 2022 to staff NOAA-wide.
