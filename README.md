The overarching vision of NMFS Open Science is to support scientific researchers within NOAA Fisheries in adopting of reproducible scientific workflows
and platforms, facilitate collaboration across offices and regions in shared scientific data science tasks, and support open science, open data and open source communities and initiatives with NOAA Fisheries.

* Support the development and sharing of training resources available to all NOAA Fisheries offices.
* Help communicate open science activities and efforts within NOAA Fishieries.
* Support user groups by providing calendars, discussion threads, and a GitHub org for sharing materials.
* Facilitate collaboration on "best practices", "report writing templates", "package template" tailored to NOAA Fisheries applications.
* Help science teams fulfil NOAA Open Science mandates: [NOAA Data Strategy](https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/Portals/0/2020%20Data%20Strategy.pdf?ver=2020-09-17-150024-997), 
[Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/).

| NOAA Fisheries is partnering with Openscapes to provide team-based training in reproducible workflows. Openscapesâ€™ training helps teams transition to robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. | The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Toolbox (NOAA FIT) is an interdisciplinary, web-based portal of operational tools that can be used for a variety of applications, including stock assessment modeling, forecasting, and data preparation for fish and protected species, as well as economic and ecosystem modeling. | The NOAA Fisheries Integrated Modeling System is a software system designed and architected to support next-generation fisheries stock assessment, ecosystem, and socioeconomic modeling. Users and developers are welcome to submit feedback using Github issues. | The NMFS R User Group supports R users across NOAA Fisheries. We host monthly meetings on topics of interest and we have an active Google Space for questions and event announcements. |
